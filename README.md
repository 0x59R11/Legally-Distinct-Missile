# Legally Distinct Missile (LDM)

This is a fork of Rocket for Unturned officially maintained by the game developers. [Read the installation instructions here.](https://github.com/SmartlyDressedGames/U3-Docs/blob/master/RocketMod.md)

# Contributing

The goals of this repository are to maintain compatibility with Unturned, maintain backwards compatibility with plugins, and fix bugs. Changes outside that scope will be made to the Unturned API rather than reworking the Rocket API. New plugins should ideally be using the game API where possible.

Issues are monitored and will be discussed, but pull requests will not be directly merged.
